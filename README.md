# TDT4195_Computer_Graphics
Part of the TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals course. Repo for the Computer Graphics part of the course 

Repositorry consists mainly of the assignments for the course on the Computer Graphics. No Machine Learning, only simulating the enviroment.


_NOTE: When I first started the course I knew barebones OpenGL pipeline and Rust, so prepare to look at some cursed code solutions._

_(Code safety, pffffff, what is that)_
